Slightly concerning","Mental health impact on managerial and office staff. In talking with industry colleagues, my experience is that many facilities have cut back on the staff responsible for ensuring that the facility is operating in an efficient and structured manner, while expanding the production capacity of the facility. It leaves many of these employees in a position where they are stretched thin and feel overwhelmed. Conversely, many facilities are putting policies in place to improve the quality of life for hourly workers to try to attract and keep workers in an environment where it is hard to find new workers at wage rates that previously attracted workers.","5 -

Grocery stores are also offering close to 15 for the same. There are many food facilities who were previously between 11 (state minimum) and 15 an hour for unskilled labor. Customers aren't always willing to accept price increases. So it is a balance of splitting increased labor costs with customers, which makes thin margins thinner.","2 -
